FLVIZ - DFA simulator
=============================================================

My "Formal languages" class provided the universal input file
format and my project was to deliver a visual browser for the
files and interactive menu to be able to simulate state
transitions.

I've used Qt. The biggest challenge was getting it on time and
making it work under Windows.

Checked-in stuff should be enough to run it on Windows XP, but
you're on your own there. It was run and tested only for the
purposes of that class. I haven't touched it ever since.
